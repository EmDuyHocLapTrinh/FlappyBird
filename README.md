# FlappyBird
!!! This is my first programming project, so look not good at all, so don't be too strict with it. Thanks <3

1. Get all the file in the file"img_sound_file" out, to stay in the same with the FlappyBird.
2. Go to the game file and run it. 
3. That's all.

Any feedback, can send to this mail : congduy13579@gmail.com

Thank you <3
